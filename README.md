# Hate-Speech-Identification-Model
A classifier leveraging the nltk and sklearn library  to categorize given text into offensive, hate or neither.
Machine Learning for the greater good.Using the knowledge of NLP and machine learning models I chose to invest my time in this project as I believe learning the skills to help public cause is the need of the hour.
The data used to train the model is based on tweets which I aquired through Kaggle.
The link to the data is given here:[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset)
Models used:KNN,Naive Bayes,SVM,Logistic Regression

Currently a work in progress...
