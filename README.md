# Hate Speech Identification Model

This project aims to develop a classifier using the NLTK and scikit-learn libraries to categorize given text into offensive, hate speech, or neither. It leverages machine learning techniques to contribute to addressing the issue of hate speech online.

## Motivation

Machine learning for the greater good. With the knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models, I chose to invest my time in this project as I believe learning the skills to combat hate speech and offensive language is crucial in today's digital age.

## Data Source

The dataset used to train the model consists of tweets, acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset). It provides a diverse collection of text samples to train and test the hate speech identification model.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models were explored and implemented:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

## Work in Progress

This project is currently ongoing, with continuous improvements and refinements being made to the classifier models. Updates and further insights will be provided as the project progresses.

Feel free to contribute and provide feedback to enhance the effectiveness of the hate speech identification model. Together, we can strive towards a safer and more inclusive online environment.
